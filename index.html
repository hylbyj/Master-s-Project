		<div id = "container-text">
			<p>Students are now paying nearly twice they did 20 years ago. High tuition forced the millennial generation to deal with high education debt years after graduating from college.</p>
			<p>It is easy to find the reason: public funding cuts.</p>

		<p>Last year, in Virginia, funding has been cut by nearly 25 percent; in Maryland, by 12 percent; and in the District of Columbia , 5.4 percent.</p>
		<p>Tuition at public universities, meanwhile, has risen. The cost of Arizona's four­year public colleges has increased more than 80 percent, to $10,065 from $5,572.</p>
		<p>By comparison, tuition in the District of Columbia has climbed 71 percent since the recession, while it has gone up 32 percent in Virginia. Maryland schools raised tuition by only 3 percent during that time, but several imposed an additional midyear increase of 2 percent for the spring semester that started this week. Annual published tuition at fouryear public colleges has risen by $1,936, or 28 percent, since the 2007-08 school year, after adjusting for inflation.</p>

			<p>Here is an deep analysis of what happened in Colorado State University Over the years. In 2013, due to financial deficiency, CSU-Pueblo had to cut off 20 faculties. However, CSU-Pueblo received the most state fund in 2012. In the past decade, as many public universities who struggled with descending state fund, CSU-Pueblo's tried different ways to boost enrollment. However, enrollment did not change much. As a result, they raise the tuition fee instead. The average tuition fee per student is more than twice as 10 years ago.</p>

			<p>Colorado State University-Pueblo had to lay off up to 22 employee to make up for the $3.3 million projected deficit for 2014-2015. The university claimed the financial deficiency was because of they “enrolled less students than expected” in 2013.</p>
			<p>"I don't believe decreasing in enrollment can cause three million deficiency. The average tuition for undergraduate is around 10 thousand," Kara Mason, a senior from CSU-Pueblo said, "I think the biggest problem is that university financial board didn’t know what they were doing."
			</p>



			<p>The CSU system uses a Higher Education Funding Model called HB 14-1319. HB 14-1319, signed into law in May 2014, requires the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) to develop a new base funding formula to allocate state general fund dollars among the state's public institutions of higher education. The financial problems within the Colorado education system are getting worsen these years. A report produced by CCHE stated "Colorado is in the midst of developing performance funding models."

		20 years declining of public funding for higher education

		<div id = "container-text">
		<p>For too many years, the awarding of state higher education money has been a function of who had the better lobbyists and the most powerful alums, without reference to objective performance criteria.​An equitable system that rewards performance is a better way to make sure taxpayers get more bang for their buck in education funding.</p>
