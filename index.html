		<h2 id="timoni">Why students are paying more for public higher education</h2>
		<div id = "container-text">
			<p>For students who are attending public universities, they are now paying nearly twice as they did 20 years ago. Graduating without debt becomes impossible for more and more students, high expenses for higher education force the millennial generation to deal with student debts years after graduation.</p>

			<p>Colorado State University is the most important public universities in Colorado. It has three campuses which are Fort Collins, Pueblo and Global Campus.</p>
			<p>Colorado State University-Pueblo had to cut off up to 22 employee to make up for the $3.3 million projected deficit for 2014-2015. For the past decade, as many other public universities who've struggled with descending state funds, CSU-Pueblo's tried different ways to boost enrollment. However, enrollment did not grow as much as expected and the average tuition fee is more than twice 10 years ago.
			</p>
			<p>The university claimed the financial deficiency was because of they "enrolled less students than expected" in 2013.</p>
			<p>"I don't believe decreasing in enrollment can cause three million deficiency. The average tuition for undergraduate is around 10 thousand," Kara Mason, a senior from CSU-Pueblo who has been investigating the financial deficiency for a long time said, "I think the biggest problem is that university financial board didn't know what they were doing."</p>


			<p>The CSU system uses a Higher Education Funding Model called HB 14-1319. HB 14-1319, signed into law in May 2014, requires the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) to develop a new base funding formula to allocate state general fund dollars among the state's public institutions of higher education. The financial problems within the Colorado education system are getting worsen these years. A report produced by CCHE stated, "Colorado is in the midst of developing performance funding models." HB 14-1319 is not designed specifically for Pueblo and stresses little on objective performance criteria, so few people really know how would it work for Pueblo.

			<p>Colorado State is one of those typical states where students are now paying much more than they used to do.</p>
			<p>If we take a look at the report from State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO), there are mainly two kinds of funding making up for the public education revenue. The first one is Educational Appropriations which measure state and local support for public higher education operating expenses including ARRA funds and excludes appropriations for independent for independent institutions, financial aid for students attending independent institutions, research, hospitals, and medical education. The second one is Net Tuition which is calculated by taking the gross amount of tuition and fees, less state and institutional financial aid, tuition waivers or discounts, and medical student tuition and fees. Net tuition revenue used for capital dollar figures, include Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), Enrollment Mix Index (EMI), and higher Education Cost Adjustment (HECA).</p>
			<p>In 2002, Net Tuition accounts for 30.2% of public higher education total educational revenue, while the figure is 47.0% in 2012. Students are paying for their education because state and local support is decreasing. State governments cut funding on education almost every year, especially after 2008.</p>
			<p>It seems easy to get the conclusion: state governments are paying less of the cost of attending public universities.</p>
			<p>Let's take a close look at how Education Appropriation and Net Tuition change from 2000 to 2014 of every state in US.  The green line and area represent Net Tuition while the purple line and area represent Education Appropriation. All data are inflation adjusted.</p>

			<p>By sorting by Net Tuition or Education Appropriation, we can see the general trend: two lines are getting closer and closer or even flip through the past decade.</p>
			<p>From 2000 to 2010, the state and local tax revenue plus lottery profits actually increased by 45.5%. However, the percentage of state and local higher education support decreased every year, from 7.2% in 2000 to 6.8% in 2010. How would it happen while the amount of state and local support is increasing?</p>
			<p>The rapid growth in university enrolment.</p>
			<p>If you also notice the rapid increasing number of Full-time equivalent (FTE), a unit that indicates the workload of a student in a way that makes class loads comparable across various contexts, over years, you would probably answer this question better. State funds did increase, but not as fast as the number of students increase. Overall, the FTE enrollment increased by 15.6% of US from 2007 to 2012. The largest increase happened in Idaho, which is 36.0%, and the smallest increase belonged to California, which is 4.2%.</p>
			<p>A look back on Colorado, after 2003, the Education Appropriations per FTE kept decreasing and it was only one third of Net Tuition per FTE in 2014.</p>
			<p>Education Appropriation per FTE decreases sharply after 2007. By comparing thee data from 2007 and 2012, the average decrease of US is 23.0%. The largest decrease happened in Florida, which is surprising 40.7%. Only one state increased the percentage in education appropriation per FTE, North Dakota, which is 30.7%.</p>
			<p>Then, you probably know what makes up for the gap between the increase in general operating expense of higher education and decrease in state and local support, the public higher education net tuition revenue. The average increase rate of US is 8.3% from 2007 to 2012. The sharpest increase happened in Georgia, which is 77.5%. Only two states have decrease rates: Arkansas and Wyoming, 16.7% and 20.8% respectively.</p>

		<p>Green bubbles indicate that Net Tuition is more than 50% of overall education revenue, in other words, student are paying for the higher education.  Purple bubbles indicate the opposite.  Purple bubbles would turn to green bubbles if students were paying more that year. By hitting the play button, you can see the animation of change over the years. With only two green bubbles at the beginning, purple bubbles are becoming larger and larger and some are turning into green ones. In the end, there are 20 green bubbles, which means 20 states are paying less than students of public higher education.</p>
