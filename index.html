		<h2>Why students are paying more for higher education?</h2>

		<p>Here is an deep analysis of what happened in Colorado State University Over the years. In 2013, due to financial deficiency, CSU-Pueblo had to cut off 20 faculties. However, CSU-Pueblo received the most state fund in 2012. In the past decade, as many public universities who struggled with descending state fund, CSU-Puebloâ€™s tried different ways to boost enrollment. However, enrollment did not change much. As a result, they raise the tuition fee instead. The average tuition fee per student is more than twice as 10 years ago.</p>
