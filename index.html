		<h2 id="timoni">Why students are paying more for public higher education</h2>
		<div id = "container-text">
			<p>For students who are attending public universities, they are now paying nearly twice as students did 20 years ago. Graduating without debt becomes almost impossible for many students, high expenses for higher education force the millennial generation to deal with student debts years after graduation.</p>
			<p>Two things account for the growing unaffordable tuition: the increase in enrollment and state funding cuts.</p>

			<p>Colorado State University is the most important public university in Colorado. It has three campuses: Fort Collins, Pueblo and Global Campus.</p>
			<p>CColorado State University-Pueblo had to cut off up to 22 employee to make up for the $3.3 million projected deficit for fiscal year 2014-2015. As many other public universities who struggle with descending state funds, CSU-Pueblo tried different ways to boost enrollment in the past decade. However, enrollment did not grow as much as they expected.
			</p>
			<p>The university claimed the financial deficiency was because they “enrolled less students than expected” in 2013.</p>
			<p>"I don't believe decreasing in enrollment can cause three million deficiency. The average tuition for undergraduate is around 10 thousand," Kara Mason, a senior from CSU-Pueblo who has been investigating on the financial deficiency for a long time, said, "I think the biggest problem is that university financial board didn't know what they were doing."</p>
			<p>Kara attended the board of governors of Colorado State University meeting last December to audit the report from financial committee. However, the board put more emphasis on discussing the plan of building a new stadium in Fort Collins. The reason why Pueblo had such a huge financial deficiency was still unclear.</p>
			<p>The CSU system uses a Higher Education Funding Model called HB 14-1319. HB 14-1319, signed into law in May 2014, requires the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) to develop a new base funding formula to allocate state general fund dollars among the state's public institutions of higher education.  A report produced by CCHE stated, "Colorado is in the midst of developing performance funding models." HB 14-1319 is not designed specifically for Pueblo. Few people really know how the model would work for Pueblo.</p>

		<div id = "container-text">
			<p>Colorado State is not a single state where students are now paying much more than they used to do.</p>
			<p>If we take a look at the report from State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO), there are mainly two kinds of funding in public education revenue. The first one is educational appropriation which measures state and local support for public higher education operating expenses including American Recovery and Reinvestment (ARRA) funds for science and engineering research and infrastructure and excludes appropriations for independent for independent institutions, financial aid for students attending independent institutions, research, hospitals, and medical education. The second one is net tuition, which is calculated by taking the gross amount of tuition and fees, less state and institutional financial aid, tuition waivers or discounts, and medical student tuition and fees. Net tuition is a constant dollar figure after calculation using adjustments factors.</p>
			<p>In 2002, net tuition accounts for 30.2% of public higher education total educational revenue, while the figure is 47.0% in 2012. Students are paying more for their education because state and local support is decreasing. State government cuts funding on education almost every year, especially after 2008.</p>
			<p>It seems easy to get the conclusion: state governments are paying less of the cost of attending public universities.</p>
			<p>Let's take a close look at how education appropriation and net tuition change from 2000 to 2014 of every state in US.  The green line and area represent net tuition while the purple line and area represent education appropriation. All data are inflation adjusted.</p>

			<p>Sorting by net tuition or education appropriation, we can see the general trend: two lines are getting closer and closer or even flip in past 14 years. </p>
			<p>From 2000 to 2010, the state and local tax revenue plus lottery profits actually increased by 45.5%. However, the percentage of state and local higher education support decreased every year, from 7.2% in 2000 to 6.8% in 2010. How could it happen while the amount of state and local support is increasing?</p>
			<p>The rapid growth in university enrolment.</p>
			<p>If you also notice the rapid increasing number of full-time equivalent (FTE), a unit that indicates the workload of a student in a way that makes class loads comparable across various contexts, you would probably answer this question better. State funds did increase, but not as fast as the number of students increase. Overall, the FTE enrollment increases by 15.6% of US from 2007 to 2012. The largest increase happened in Idaho, which is 36.0%, and the smallest increase belonged to California, which is 4.2%.</p>
			<p>A look back on Colorado, after 2003, the education appropriations per FTE kept decreasing and it was only one third of net tuition per FTE in 2014.</p>
			<p>Education appropriation per FTE decreases sharply after 2007. By comparing the data from 2007 and 2012, the average decrease of education appropriation per FTE of US is 23.0%. The largest decrease happened in Florida, which is surprisingly 40.7%. Only one state has an increase in education appropriation per FTE. North Dakota has a 30.7% increase.</p>
			<p>Then, you probably know what makes up for the gap between the increase in general operating expense of higher education and the decrease in state and local support: the public higher education net tuition revenue. The average increase in net tuition per FTE of US is 8.3% from 2007 to 2012. The sharpest increase happened in Georgia, which is 77.5%. Only two states have decreases: Arkansas and Wyoming, which are 16.7% and 20.8% respectively.</p>

		<p>Green bubbles indicate that net tuition is more than 50% of overall education revenue. In other words, students are paying more for public higher education.  Purple bubbles indicate the opposite.  Purple bubble would grow into green bubble as the increase in net tuition. By hitting the play button, you can see the animation of changes from 1992 to 2012. There are only two green bubbles at the beginning. Purple bubbles are becoming larger and larger and some are turning into green ones. In the end, there are 20 green bubbles, which means there are 20 states where students are paying more than state for public higher education.</p>
