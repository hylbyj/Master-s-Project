			<p>Here is an deep analysis of what happened in Colorado State University Over the years. In 2013, due to financial deficiency, CSU-Pueblo had to cut off 20 faculties. However, CSU-Pueblo received the most state fund in 2012. In the past decade, as many public universities who struggled with descending state fund, CSU-Pueblo's tried different ways to boost enrollment. However, enrollment did not change much. As a result, they raise the tuition fee instead. The average tuition fee per student is more than twice as 10 years ago.</p>

			<p>The CSU system uses a Higher Education Funding Model called HB 14-1319. HB 14-1319, signed into law in May 2014, requires the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) to develop a new base funding formula to allocate state general fund dollars among the state's public institutions of higher education. The financial problems within the Colorado education system are getting worsen these years. A report produced by CCHE stated "Colorado is in the midst of developing performance funding models."
